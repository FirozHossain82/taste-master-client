            </h2>
            <p className="font-bold">
              JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and
              self-contained way for securely transmitting information between
              parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and
              trusted because it is digitally signed.User sign-in using username
              and password or google/facebook. Authentication server verifies the
              credentials and issues a jwt signed using either a secret salt or a
              private key. User's Client uses the JWT to access protected
              resources by passing the JWT in HTTP Authorization header

            </h2>
            <p className="font-bold">
              JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with
              any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on
              the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the
              JavaScript programming language.Node. jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime
              built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node. js uses an
              event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and
              efficient.

            </h2>
            <p className="font-bold">
              How NodeJS handle multiple client requests? NodeJS receives multiple
              client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built
              with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own
              EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and
              processes them
